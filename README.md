### Hey there 👋 I'm Ashis

🎓 I'm a sophomore in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **IIT Bhubaneswar**.  
💡 Passionate about building and learning in the intersections of **Quantitative Finance**, **Deep Learning for Time Series & Computer Vision**, and **FPGA-based Systems**.

🔍 I'm always open to collaborations in:
- Machine Learning & Deep Neural Networks
- Financial Modeling & Time-Series Forecasting
- Reinforcement Learning Projects
- FPGA and Machine Learning Applications

🚀 Currently learning and building in:
- Attention-based architectures for time-series
- Reinforcement Learning based Trading Strategies
- Open-source contribution workflows

📫 Let's connect and build something cool!  
Feel free to reach out for collaboration, discussions, or just to say hi.
